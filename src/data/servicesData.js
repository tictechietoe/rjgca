          Corporate law is a complex piece of legislation that governs the activities of not only domestic companies, LLPs but also that of foreign companies setting up their establishments in India. At every step, corporates have to comply with the plentitude of provisions contained Indian Companies Act and SEBI Regulations. We not only provide advice on ensuring compliance with these regulations but also provide secretarial support with respect to incorporation of subsidiaries anywhere in India.
